# Quantum-Inspired Neural Networks (QINN)

## Motivation
Quantum Machine Learning promises advantages but is limited by noisy,
scarce quantum hardware. This project explores whether *quantum-inspired*
principles can be embedded into classical neural networks to gain
robustness and efficiency **without quantum computers**.

## Core Idea
We introduce neural components inspired by:
- Superposition
- Interference
- Phase-sensitive representations

These components are implemented using standard PyTorch operations
and trained on classical hardware.

## Research Question
Can quantum-inspired architectural biases improve robustness and
generalization compared to classical neural networks?

## Key Contributions (Planned)
- A novel quantum-inspired neural layer
- Theoretical motivation
- Empirical evaluation against classical baselines
- Open-source reproducible framework
